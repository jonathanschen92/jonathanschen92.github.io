			<h1><strong> My Super Awesome Webpage </strong></h1>

			<p>This is a test of the great skills you have acquired this far in front end fundamentals. It's your job to build this simple little page yourself using what you have learned. Don't get frustrated, there is always a path forward just use your jedi mind tricks and the great stack overflow if you get stuck. <b> Remember: No Peeking At The Page Source. </b></p>

			<h2> About you </h2>
			<img id="fb profile-pic" src = "images/Jchen_picture.jpg">
			<p> I think you should use this section to get a little creative and talk a little about yourself and link it to an image of yourself somewhere out there on the interwebs. You can do this by right-clicking and copying the image source from one web page to your own. It's a little tricky getting the text to sit next to the image like this but I have faith in you both. You can also write your own message here instead of using this one. </p>

			<h2> Dream Resume </h2>
			<p>I liked hearing about you so much I decided I wanted you to list some professional accomplishments. Except I'm not really interested in what you have done but rather what you will do. After you copy this paragraph modify the lists below to show me what your resume will look like when you are 40. <em> A person's dreams often tell us more than their reality.
			</em></p>

				<ul> 
				<li> Produced my own music album and toured the world with Eric Clapton and John Mayer.</li>
				<li> Started my own lifestyle brand in men's luxury casual wear.</li>
				<li> Designed and developed the most widely used cohesive online and brick-and-mortar retail experience.</li>
				<li> Mastered conversational and written Mandarin.</li>
				<li> Had a custom guitar built for me by Gibson Guitars as a gift.</li>
				</ul>

		<h2> Great Quotes </h2>
		<p> Tell me something inspiring that someone else said :). You are going to want to use a special HTML element just for quotes I never told you about...(aka "blockquote") <p>

		<blockquote>â€œBe more concerned with your character than with your reputation, for your character is what you are, while your reputation is merely what others think you are."

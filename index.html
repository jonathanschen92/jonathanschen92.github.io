			<h1><strong> My Super Awesome Webpage </strong></h1>

			<p>This is a test of the great skills you have acquired this far in front end fundamentals. It's your job to build this simple little page yourself using what you have learned. Don't get frustrated, there is always a path forward just use your jedi mind tricks and the great stack overflow if you get stuck. <b> Remember: No Peeking At The Page Source. </b></p>

		<h2> About you </h2>
		<p> I think you should use this section to get a little creative and talk a little about yourself and link it to an image of yourself somewhere out there on the interwebs. You can do this by right-clicking and copying the image source from one web page to your own. It's a little tricky getting the text to sit next to the image like this but I have faith in you both. You can also write your own message here instead of using this one. </p>

			<h2> Dream Resume </h2>
			<p>I liked hearing about you so much I decided I wanted you to list some professional accomplishments. Except I'm not really interested in what you have done but rather what you will do. After you copy this paragraph modify the lists below to show me what your resume will look like when you are 40. <em> A person's dreams often tell us more than their reality.
			</em></p>

				<ul> 
				<li> Won Pulitzer Prize for Literature in 2023.</li>
				<li> Sold company to Google for 7 billion dollars.</li>
				<li> Successfully summited Aconcagua, El Capitan, and Denali.</li>
				<li> Sailed from San Diego to Patagonia in 2024.</li>
				<li> Saved the world from alien extinction like Will Smith.</li>
				</ul>

		<h2> Great Quotes </h2>
		<p> Tell me something inspiring that someone else said :). You are going to want to use a special HTML element just for quotes I never told you about... <p>
